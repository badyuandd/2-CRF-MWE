This is the implementation of the double chained CRF used for predicting MWE and supersenses. 

UW-CSE at SemEval-2016 Task 10: Detecting multiword expressions and supersenses using double-chained conditional random fields. Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Noah A. Smith, and Su-In Lee. In Proceedings of the NAACL Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval 2016), San Diego, CA, June 2016.

We have implemented a Conditional Random Field and a Double-Chained Conditional Random Field model for joint learning of multiword expressions and supersenses.

The feature extraction is based on AMALGrAM 2.0 (A Machine Analyzer of Lexical Groupings And Meanings)
